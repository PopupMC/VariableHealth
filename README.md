## Variable Health

Technically should be called **Interesting Mobs** since it's no longer about health and much more complicated.

When a new mob is spawned, it's assigned a level between 1-100 which is stored onto the mob itself, this level is very important in setting up the newly spawned mob.

* Bosses are treated differently, they are more difficult but have many effects and such not applied to them
* Tamed animals or mobs with custom names are skipped and not messed with

**Creeper**, **Hoglin**, **Llama**, **Phantom**, **Piglin**, **Snowman**, **Vindicator**, and **Zombie** all have settings specific to them applied based on level and a touch of chance. For example Creepers being charged and blast radius, Vindicator's Johny status, and Zombies burn in daylight and break down doors will be set or unset depending on level with added randomization.

There's also

* A chance of being silenced if on a high enough level
* Extra Strength is added based on level
* Extra Resistence is added based on level

A number of additional effects can be applied if the level is high enough

* A chance of increased speed scaled to level
* A chance of increase haste scaled to level
* A chance of high jumping scaled to level
* A chance to be fire resistant and/or underwater breathing
* A chance for an additional health boost
* A chance for slow falling

Only past a certain level can mobs pickup loot.

Finally

* The maximum health is scaled randomly based on level
* The maximum underwater breathing is scaled randomly based on level

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
